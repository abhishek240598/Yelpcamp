# here working on comments and user data association file
Here campground schema have all comments id in his collection whereas comment schema have perticular user id and name store in it reference taking of user schema.

## comments + user.
## campgrounds + user
I'd built a Campground application built with Node, MongoDB, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap where users can put different campgrounds pictures and details visible to everyone. It has Edit and Deletes functionality as well as users can put comments on all existing posts with all CRUD operations available. I'd had put login/signup functionality for authentication purposes along with flash messages.
