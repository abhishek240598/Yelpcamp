I'd built a Campground application built with Node, MongoDB, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap where users can put different campgrounds pictures and details visible to everyone. It has Edit and Deletes functionality as well as users can put comments on all existing posts with all CRUD operations available. I'd had put login/signup functionality for authentication purposes along with flash messages.
